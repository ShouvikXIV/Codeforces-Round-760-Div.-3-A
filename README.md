A. Polycarp and Sums of Subsequences


Polycarp had an array a of 3 positive integers. He wrote out the sums of all non-empty subsequences of this array, sorted them in non-decreasing order, and got an array b of 7 integers.

For example, if a={1,4,3}, then Polycarp wrote out 1, 4, 3, 1+4=5, 1+3=4, 4+3=7, 1+4+3=8. After sorting, he got an array b={1,3,4,4,5,7,8}.
Unfortunately, Polycarp lost the array a. He only has the array b left. Help him to restore the array a.
